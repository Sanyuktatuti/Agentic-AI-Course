      "Okay, so I need to figure out what the capital of France is. Hmm, I think I remember learning this in school, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall. I know that France is a country in Europe, and I've heard of a few cities there. Paris comes to mind, but I'm not 100% certain if that's the capital or just a major city. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think Paris is the capital. But I should double-check to make sure I'm not mixing it up with another country. For example, I know that London is the capital of England, and Berlin is the capital of Germany. So, Paris being the capital of France makes sense because it's one of the most well-known cities in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I remember seeing the Eiffel Tower in pictures, and I associate that with Paris. I think government buildings and embassies are usually in the capital, so that would make sense. I don't think any other city in France is as prominent as Paris. Maybe Lyon or Marseille, but those don't sound like capitals. \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is through famous landmarks. The Eiffel Tower is iconic and is in Paris, so it's likely the capital. Plus, when I hear about the French government or the President of France, they're often associated with Paris. That must mean it's the capital. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't remember any other city in France being referred to as the capital. So, putting it all together, I'm pretty confident that Paris is the capital of France. I don't think I'm confusing it with another country's capital because the other European capitals I know are different. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure, I can think of other countries and their capitals. Like, Spain's capital is Madrid, Italy's is Rome, and Germany's is Berlin. So, France's capital being Paris fits the pattern of each country having its own distinct capital city. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm solid on this. Paris is definitely the capital of France. I don't recall any other city in France being as significant on a governmental level. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n",

      "\n",
      "The capital of France is Paris. This conclusion is supported by the recognition of Paris as a prominent global city, home to iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and its association with the French government and presidency. Additionally, it aligns with the pattern of other European countries having distinct capitals, reinforcing Paris as the capital of France. \n",

      "\n",
      "First, I know that India is a country in South Asia. It's a big country with a lot of people and a rich history. I've heard of cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Kolkata. Mumbai is a major city, often associated with the film industry, Bollywood. Delhi, on the other hand, I think is more in the north part of India.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember from school that the capital of a country is where the government is located. So, where is the Indian government based? I think it's Delhi because I've heard of the Prime Minister of India and the President having their offices there. Maybe there's a famous building like the Parliament House or something similar in Delhi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I also recall that sometimes countries have their capital changed. For example, Brazil moved its capital from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília. Did India do something like that? I think India's capital was once Calcutta (now Kolkata) during the British rule, but after independence, they changed it. Or was it that the British made Calcutta the capital first, then moved it to Delhi? I'm a bit confused here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the British East India Company had their base in Kolkata initially, but as the British Empire took over more of India, they moved the capital to Delhi because of its central location and historical significance. So, during British rule, Delhi became the capital. After India gained independence in 1947, Delhi remained the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting this together, the capital of India should be New Delhi. Wait, New Delhi versus Delhi. I think Delhi is the city, and New Delhi is the part where the government buildings are. So, when people say the capital is New Delhi, they're referring to the administrative part of the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think if there are any other cities that could be the capital. Mumbai is a major economic hub, but I don't think it's the capital. Bangalore is known for IT, Kolkata for culture, but none of these are capitals. So, yes, New Delhi must be the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also remember landmarks like the India Gate and the Red Fort being in Delhi. The President's house, Rashtrapati Bhavan, is there too. So, that makes sense because capitals usually have these important buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, could it be that some sources say Delhi and others say New Delhi? I think New Delhi is the official capital, and it's a part of the larger Delhi metropolitan area. So, sometimes people just say Delhi for simplicity, but technically, it's New Delhi.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm pretty confident now that the capital of India is New Delhi. To make sure, maybe I can think of other countries' capitals for comparison. Like, the capital of the US is Washington D.C., which is a district, not a city. Similarly, New Delhi is a district within the larger Delhi area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I think the government of India has its ministries and departments in New Delhi, so that solidifies it as the capital. The Supreme Court and other important institutions are there too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary, after thinking through the possible options, historical context, and the presence of government buildings, I conclude that the capital of India is New Delhi.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The capital of India is New Delhi. It serves as the administrative center, housing key government institutions such as the Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhavan (the President's residence), and the Supreme Court. New Delhi is a part of the larger Delhi metropolitan area and has been the capital since India's independence in 1947, replacing Kolkata which was the capital during British rule. The city is known for landmarks like India Gate and the Red Fort, and is distinct from Delhi, which is the broader city area. Thus, while Delhi is often used colloquially, New Delhi is the official capital.\n"
